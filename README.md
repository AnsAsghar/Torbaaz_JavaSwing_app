# Torbaaz - Restaurant Menu Management System üçΩÔ∏è

A feature-rich Java-based desktop application developed to manage restaurant menus effectively, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and GUI development using Java Swing.

This project was part of my 3rd semester OOP course and served as both a 4th assignment and a final lab exam. It exemplifies my understanding of core Java concepts, file handling, and interactive GUI design. Additionally, I transformed this GUI application into a console-based backend version for my final lab submission‚Äîkeeping the functionality intact while adapting the interface!
