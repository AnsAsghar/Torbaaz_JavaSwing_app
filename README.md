# Torbaaz - Restaurant Menu Management System 🍽️

A feature-rich **Java-based desktop application** developed to efficiently manage restaurant menus, showcasing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **GUI development** using **Java Swing**.

This project was part of my **3rd semester OOP course** and served as both a **4th assignment** and a **final lab exam**. It exemplifies my understanding of **core Java concepts**, file handling, and interactive GUI design. Additionally, I transformed this GUI application into a **console-based backend version** for my final lab submission—retaining full functionality while adapting the interface!

## 🔄 Console-Based Version
For my final OOP lab submission, I converted the project into a **console-based system**:
- **Interface Overhaul**: Replaced GUI with a text-based interface using `Scanner` for input.
- **Simplified Logic**: Implemented core functionality via `switch` cases and streamlined backend operations.

### 🛠️ Changes in the Console Version
- Removed GUI components while retaining core functionalities.
- Added CLI-based navigation with user-friendly prompts.
