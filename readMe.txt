# Project Summary

This project is a Java-based application for managing a restaurant menu. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the menu and perform various operations. The main features of the application include:

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to sign up and log in. A default admin user can log in with the username "admin" and password "p".
- **Menu Management**: Users can view menu items, which are loaded from a dataset file. The menu includes item details such as name, price, category, and availability.
- **File Handling**: The application uses file handling to store and retrieve user data and menu items.

The application is structured with several Java classes, including:

- `RestaurantMenuApp`: Manages the GUI and user interactions.
- `FileHandler`: Handles file operations for loading and saving data.
- `User`: Represents user information and credentials.
- `MenuItem`: Represents individual menu items.

This project can be run using any Java IDE, such as NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA.
